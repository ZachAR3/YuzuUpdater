# YuzuEAUpdater
-Download and start yuzu directly after update. (Replace old files and launch)

-Can install from scratch too if no installation found.

-List all change since last update.

-You can configure the yuzu executable file by adding a launchUpdater.txt file in folder and write the exe to execute in it.

# Recommendation
-You must put the exe in the yuzu folder.

-Work only for EA access and windows.

-Start yuzu from the updater for automaticaly update :).
